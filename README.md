                              SOC project: Interactive experiences with Three.js
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.                          
Till mid-term, I have gone through HTML, CSS and Javascript(not completely). In this repo I have included 
all the work, learning and mini projects(a webpage explaining my IITB journey) which mostly include HTML and CSS
and a little bit of Javascript. Right now, I have almost aquired all the beginner level knowledge HTML and
CSS, howevver I am still lackng in javascript and working on it. most of my learning is based on the code with
harry's  youtube course on webdev till now, and rest with the help of chat gpt. In the project submitted in
this repo is mostly done by me except the introductory para, color-code and the javascript part (used chat gpt
for suggestion). Along with this project I've also submitted my practice work done along the way.
